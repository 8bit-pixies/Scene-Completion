This is a naive Python implementation of Local Context Matching as shown in [Scene Completion Using Millions of Photographs](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/scene-completion/) which was completed as part of Georgia Tech's Computational Photography Course. 

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook I worked off as well as the functions I used to generate the local context matching. More information of the approach can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ObIpms39d0bY6UPnAt8woTY66nbgHukCCf_94OQjhtQ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).
