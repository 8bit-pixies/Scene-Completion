This is a naive Python implementation of Local Context Matching as shown in [Scene Completion Using Millions of Photographs](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/scene-completion/) which was completed as part of Georgia Tech's Computational Photography Course. 

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook I worked off as well as the functions I used to generate the local context matching. More information of the approach can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ObIpms39d0bY6UPnAt8woTY66nbgHukCCf_94OQjhtQ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).

Other Notes and Work
--------------------

The Flickr Download code is based on the code ["Download Images from Flickr with Python"](http://halotis.com/download-images-from-flickr-with-python/)

Whilst my (failed) attempt at the gist descriptor is based on the hints provided on [quora](https://www.quora.com/Computer-Vision/What-is-a-GIST-descriptor). The GIST descriptor is used to perform similar image matching within the [Scene Completion paper](graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/scene-completion/). 

The sample images are based on the [Scene Completion work assignment which was implemented in Matlab](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs129/results/final/zyp/)
